# Networking – Routing, Switching, and Configuration 

## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on networking lab. These labs were completed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and cover a wide range of fundamental networking concepts, configurations, and troubleshooting practices relevant to real-world Cisco-based environments.

---

## What I Learned

- IP addressing, subnetting, and VLSM  
- Router configuration and interface management  
- Static, default, and floating routing  
- OSPF dynamic routing protocol  
- VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) and traffic filtering  
- Network Address Translation (NAT)  
- DHCP server setup and relay  
- Switch security, port configurations, and trunking  

Each lab is organized by topic in its own folder with detailed step-by-step explanations, configuration examples, and sample output.

## Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- CLI-based configuration and troubleshooting  
- Ping, traceroute, and `show` commands for validation  
- Addressing plans and topology designs

| Folder                            | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `ip-addressing`                   | Classful IPs, subnet masks, binary conversion   |
| `subnetting-vlsm`                | Efficient subnetting using VLSM                 |
| `router-basic-config`            | Hostname, banners, passwords, interface IPs     |
| `static-default-floating-routing`| Manual route management                         |
| `ospf-routing`                   | OSPF setup and neighbor formation               |
| `vlans-trunking-intervlan`       | VLAN configuration and inter-VLAN routing       |
| `acl-nat`                        | Access control and NAT translations             |
| `dhcpv4`                         | DHCP server and relay configuration             |


Each topic folder includes:

- A detailed `README.md` with explanations and CLI examples  
- Screenshots 
- Configuration steps suitable for simulation or real hardware  

This repo serves as both a **learning portfolio** and a **personal reference** for Cisco networking fundamentals.
